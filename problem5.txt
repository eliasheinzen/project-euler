Divisibility Rules

1 - Any integer (not a fraction) is divisible by 1
2 - The last digit is even (0,2,4,6,8)
3 - The sum of the digits is divisible by 3
4 - The last 2 digits are divisible by 4
5 - The last digit is 0 or 5
6 - Is even and is divisible by 3 (it passes both the 2 rule and 3 rule above)
7 - Double the last digit and subtract it from a number made by the other digits. The result must be divisible by 7. (We can apply this rule to that answer again)
8 - The last three digits are divisible by 8
9 - The sum of the digits is divisible by 9
10 - The number ends in 0
11 - Add and subtract digits in an alternating pattern (add digit, subtract next digit, add next digit, etc). Then check if that answer is divisible by 11.
12 - The number is divisible by both 3 and 4 (it passes both the 3 rule and 4 rule above)
